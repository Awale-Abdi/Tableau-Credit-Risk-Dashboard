<h1 align="center">Credit Risk Dashboard: Tableau Insights into Senior Borrower Profiles</h1>

## 📊 Overview

This project was completed as a **solo assignment** for a graduate-level **Data Visualization** course using **Tableau**. Assigned the role of a **Credit Risk Manager** at a German bank, I built two **interactive dashboards** to explore customer credit risk—delivering targeted, actionable insights over general summaries.

With only a couple of days to deliver, I made a **strategic decision to focus on the 65+ demographic**, a segment with unique credit behaviors often overlooked in mainstream analysis. Rather than dilute the impact with surface-level observations, I concentrated on extracting **nuanced trends** in credit behavior, housing status, employment, and foreign worker credit usage among seniors.

## 🎯 Objective

- Identify risk profiles based on the `good_bad` credit status
- Examine how **age**, **employment status**, and **existing credit** affect loan outcomes
- Build **interactive Tableau dashboards** with filters, hover actions, and reference lines
- Present **strategic recommendations** to guide risk mitigation and financial product design

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Seniors (65+) demonstrate **conservative credit behavior**, with a higher share of favorable credit profiles.
- Despite their low credit volumes, **unskilled and unemployed elderly workers** showed surprising creditworthiness—an overlooked opportunity for safe lending.
- **Seniors in rental housing** appear more credit-constrained and have higher bad credit rates, signaling the need for flexible, risk-adjusted products.
- Foreign-born elderly workers show **both risk and opportunity**, with higher credit use but mixed repayment trends.
- There's an observed **shift toward ‘critical accounts’** among seniors, possibly tied to fixed retirement income and healthcare burdens.

## 📈 Dashboard Features

- 🔗 **Two Tableau dashboards**, each featuring multiple linked visualizations
- ✅ **Filter actions** for drilling into demographics and risk segments
- ✅ **Hover actions** for contextual tooltips
- ✅ **Reference lines** tied to dynamic parameters
- 🎯 **Dashboards designed around stakeholder utility**, not just visual flair

> Dashboards are filtered for 65+ by default but allow toggling across all age groups for full interactivity.

## 🧾 Strategic Recommendations

- **Auto Financing Plans for Seniors** – Custom lending with low interest and extended terms  
- **Financial Literacy Workshops** – Focused on credit use, debt management, and retirement planning  
- **Inclusive Products for Low-Income Seniors** – Flexible repayment and tailored risk models  
- **Support for Seniors with 'Critical Accounts'** – Counseling and negotiated repayment structures  
- **Products for Elderly Renters** – Credit lines that don’t depend on asset ownership  

These recommendations stem from Tableau-driven insights and align product strategy with real-world credit behaviors, especially within underserved segments.

## 🧠 Project Strategy & Stakeholder Focus

> "This report delves into the complex landscape of credit distribution across demographics, with a specific focus on seniors aged 65 and above. By dissecting variables such as credit status, employment patterns, credit spending habits, and housing situations, we aimed to extract actionable insights for strategic credit management."

To maximize value under time constraints, I **focused my report on the senior demographic**—a decision that avoided redundancy and gave stakeholders focused insights they likely hadn’t already considered. This approach shows **data storytelling under constraints** and the ability to translate analysis into **real-world policy suggestions**.
