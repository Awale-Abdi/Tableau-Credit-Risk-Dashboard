<h1 align="center">Credit Risk Dashboard: Tableau Insights into Senior Borrower Profiles</h1>

## 📊 Overview

This project was completed as a **solo assignment** for a graduate-level **Data Visualization** course using **Tableau**. Assigned the role of a **Credit Risk Manager** at a German bank, I designed two **interactive dashboards** to explore customer credit risk—delivering targeted, actionable insights instead of broad generalizations.

Given a **tight turnaround of just a few days**, I made a strategic decision to **focus the analysis on seniors aged 65 and above**, a population often overlooked in risk modeling. Rather than overwhelming stakeholders with surface-level summaries across all demographics, I tailored my analysis toward a demographic with distinctive behaviors and rising relevance—ensuring relevance and value in every insight delivered.

## 🎯 Objective

- Identify **risk profiles** most prone to default using the `good_bad` label
- Analyze how **age**, **existing credit**, and **employment status** affect credit risk
- Deliver **targeted recommendations** based on **interactive Tableau dashboards**
- Leverage filter, hover, and parameter actions to guide stakeholder exploration

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Seniors (65+) demonstrate overwhelmingly **good credit behavior**, despite being a smaller subset of the dataset
- **Skilled workers** and **Big Earners** surprisingly have mixed credit profiles, challenging assumptions that income equals creditworthiness
- Seniors in **rented housing** are more **credit-constrained** and display higher risk, highlighting a need for rental-specific financial tools
- **Unskilled and unemployed seniors**—although small in sample—show surprisingly positive credit behavior, suggesting a low-risk niche segment worth testing

## 🧠 Why Focus on Seniors?

In just a few days, **trying to generalize across all demographics would dilute actionable insights**. Instead, I zeroed in on the **65+ group**, providing management with **deep, focused takeaways** they may not already know—backed by targeted visuals and concise recommendations. This decision ensured every minute of stakeholder time added value and prompted meaningful follow-up questions.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

Due to the dataset’s **small sample size**, especially for seniors, this project serves as a **hypothesis-generating exercise**. All conclusions should be validated against broader datasets before institutional implementation.
